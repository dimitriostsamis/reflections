What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.Git directory is created which is needed to track changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I can choose only the files I need to be tracked.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can add only one file at the time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

I can use branches to make different versions of projects. It is helpful since
there will be separate histories for each of them.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

I can see what commits belong to what branches and what commits are reachable.
