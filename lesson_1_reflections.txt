How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It allowed me to easily spot typos and other variables mistakes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can easily revert to some earlier point if something goes wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually hoosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs
having vesions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

I can control the number of commits and not clutter my log with unnecessary commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while
others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is made for programmers mainly, and thus there are many cases that a program needs more than one file
at the time.
Google Docs is mostly about single document editing that have no connection to each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can find all the changes with git log and then compare the two commits I need.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can easily revert to the older version and even find what caused the problem.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I can use it for my future projects, small coding for example.
